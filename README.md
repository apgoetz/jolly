# Overview 
Jolly is a small bookmarking application for desktop usage.

It extends the concept of your browser bookmarking interface, but
alows these bookmarks to access files on your local file system, as
run commands in your shell.

# Why was this created
My work requires collaborating with others using files stored on
network shared drives. ( a common working model). While browsers have
gotten very good at storing bookmarks to web applications, they are
not optimized for storing links documents that need to open in other
programs (for example, excel spreadsheets). They also are not very
good about mixing URL encoding with shell-escaping. 

There are also plenty of programs that index documents and allow for
searching them (For example, the venerable
[launchy](https://www.launchy.net/)). This is a different usecase
though that requires searching and indexing documents. Jolly solves
the problem a simpler way, by requiring the user to add tags to
documents for the filtering.

To use Jolly, simply run the `jolly` executable. Jolly will look for a
suitable [configuration file](file-format.md#locations) `jolly.toml`. 

By default, Jolly won't show any results: just tell you how many entries it has loaded:

![startup page](static/startup.png)

You can search for an entry by typing in text: Jolly will use the
title of the entry and any [tags](file-format.md#tags) associated
with the entry to find results:

To open the entry, you can select it using the arrow and enter keys,
or click it with the mouse.
